# PowerMeter
# These files for arduino nano based power meter using 
# small TFT display also monitoring temperature.  
# Power sensing uses log RF sensor chip with amplfier 
# feeding 2 different gain ranges to the adc inputs of 
# the arduino.  
# Different calibration settings are configured for 
# frequency bands since my directional coupler is not 
# flat across all the bands the RF sensors can detect. 
# Frequence range can be switched from the console and 
# data can also be collected for logging.
